Sequences - most basic data structure
    each element is assigned a number (index)
    first index is 0, second is 1, etc.
    6 built-in types of sequences in python
        indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, checking for membership


Lists - comma separated values
    can mix data types

    format:
        listName = [item1, item2, ..., itemN]

    accessing values in list:
        listName[index]
        ex: print(list1[2])
    
    updating values in list:
        listName[index] = newValue
        ex: list1[2] = 2009
    
    deleting values from list:
        del listName[index]
        ex: del list1[2]

List operations

    checking list length
    ex: len([1, 2, 3])  ---> 3

    adding lists
    [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] ---> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Dictionaries
    built-in mapping type
    values mapped to keys
        typically referred to as key:value pairs
    
    creating empty dictionary:
    {}
    ex: eng2sp = {}
        eng2sp["one"] = "uno"

    Dictionaries used for hashing
        allows for quick access to values, tuples is much slower
        accesses the keys, not the indices
